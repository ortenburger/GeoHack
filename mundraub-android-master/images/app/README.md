Images
======

These are the raw images we use for the android app.
If you know how to export the Android Studio Vector to SVG,
this folder is obsolete.
Until that, you can edit the images here and load them into the app.

You can load the files into Android Studio like this:

1. Open the `app/res/drawable` folder.
2. Right-Click -> new -> Vector Asset
3. Choose the `mundraub-android/images` folder.
4. Choose the asset and include it.
