# Setup

These steps should prepare you for developing the app.

## Setup App Development

1. **Install Android Studio**  
   The app is developed on [Android Studio].
   Please download and install it.
2. **Install Git**  
   While installing Android Studio, get the source code on [GitHub]. 
   [Git] is used to develop the app in a distributed way.
   Please install [Git] or the [GitHub Desktop].
3. **[Fork]** the repository to your GitHub Account.
4. **Get the source code**  
   The code should appear automatically in GitHub Desktop.
   If using the command line client, clone the app with this command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER_NAME/mundraub-android.git
   ```
   Please replace `YOUR_USER_NAME` with your GitHub username.
5. **Open the source code**  
   Once Android Studio is installed, click on File â†’ Open and navigate to the project.
6. Now you are **ready to go**. You can change the source code and build the app!
   Please view the [Contribution Guidelines] if you would like to share your improvements or just
   submit them and we will talk.

## Translations

You can translate the app from English to your preferred language using [Transifex].
To build the app with translations included, use the Transifex client and
download all of them at once.

Before building the app, download the current translations to include them in the build and test
different layouts e.g. in German which uses the most space.
To download the translations, follow the steps below:

1. Install [Transifex client][tx-client].
2. Go to the repository root
   ```
   cd mundraub-android
   ```
3. Pull the latest translations. You may need to log in or get an API key.
   ```
   tx pull --all
   ```

## Map

The [map] is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript website which is displayed 
in the app as an [Android WebView].
This map can be worked on locally and in the app.
To display the map, you need a web browser like Firefox.

### Proxy

Mundraub.org does not allow JavaScript access to the map
directly because it does not set the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
header therefore we need a proxy for this map.
The proxy can be run with the [command `scripts/runHTTPProxy.sh`][script-proxy]
You need `java` and `javac` for this.

Please the the [API] to know what the proxy provides.
